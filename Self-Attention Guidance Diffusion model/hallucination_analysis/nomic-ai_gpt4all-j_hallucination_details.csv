In '1984' by George Orwell, the theme of dystopia is explored through the portrayal of a totalitarian government that controls every aspect of its citizens' lives. The government is portrayed as a single, all-powerful entity that seeks to eliminate any form of dissent or opposition. The novel portrays a society where people are reduced to mere cogs in a machine, with no personal freedom or autonomy.

In contrast, 'The Handmaid's Tale' by Margaret Atwood explores the theme of dystopia through the story of a society that has been reduced to a patriarchal, oppressive regime. The novel portrays a society where women are stripped of their rights and freedoms, and are reduced to mere objects of male desire. The government is portrayed as a male-dominated institution that seeks to control and manipulate its female population.

While both novels share a common theme of dystopian oppression, they differ in their portrayal of the government and its impact on society. '1984' portrays a totalitarian government that seeks to control its citizens' every move, while 'The Handmaid's Tale' portrays a patriarchal regime that seeks to control and manipulate its female population.",6,0,1
